# Transitioning to JS

## JavaScript What is Weird
- declaration keywords
- more syntax
- semicolons
- curly mustaches
- parens
- return, explicit
- hoisting
- coersion
- passing functions into functions


## JavaScript History
  - Marc Andreessen co-founder of Netscape envisioned a more dynamic web
  - the web needed a scripting language that could interact with the DOM
  - the marketing decisions Netscape made informed the basic structure of JS
  - created by Brandon Eich at Netscape in 10 days in 1995
  - based off of functional languages with some object-oriented patterns
  - was not a highly respected programming language for about 10 years
## Standards:
  - the standard for JavaScript implementations is called ECMAScript
  - the standard is updated yearly and the standard for that year is called ECMAScript 20xx (or sometimes ES5, ES6, etc)
  - [Browser Compatibility](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
  - transpiling: we use the features of the language we want, translate it into something all browsers understand (using Babel)


## Review Request-Response Cycle
- In the browser
  - A user enters an address in the address bar (or clicks a link)
  - We get a response back with data in binary, text, HTML, or JSON
  - The user usually sees a loading indicator (like a spinning circle) near the address bar
  - Included in that HTML are links to images, fonts, stylesheets, and scripts
  - Each one of those links means another request by the browser but without refreshing the page
  - When all the external links have loaded, the page itself is finished loading
- Loaded JavaScript
  - runs directly in the client (unlike ERB all put together on server and sent back as a string)
  - JavaScript can be written directly in HTML through a `script` tag
  - It can also be loaded externally through a `script` tag with a `src` attribute
  - When the browser sees JavaScript, it attempts to run it immediately
- JavaScript implementations
  - Each browser has its own [JavaScript engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine) or implementation
  - The [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) is the interface between the loaded HTML and the JavaScript code we write
  - Most browsers are converging on agreeing on web standards, but browsers need ability to add proprietary features to CSS, JS, and DOM

##Some Brief Exposure to DOM

## Data Types
  - 7 types
	- boolean
	- null
	- number
	- object 
		+ array
		+ POJOS
		+ functions
		+ null
		+ promise
		+ array like objects
	- string
	- symbol
	- undefined

  - What is falsy? (6 things)
  	+ 0
  	+ false
  	+ NaN
  	+ null
  	+ undefined
  	+ ""

  - coersion
  - PBV, PBR

## Variables
  - declaration versus assignment
  - hoisting
  - let, const, var
  - scoping
  - for loops

## Functions
 - functions are objects
 - store in variables
 - functions have names
 - immediately invoked function expression IIFE
 - have scope
 - explicit returns
 - pass as arguments to other functions
 - return functions from functions


## How to do the Labs
- Mocha runs in browser, get used to working with code there
- console.log('>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>')
- debugger (need console open)
