@here before you start on the lab, have a check-in with your partner. Talk about how you’re feeling today, and anything that might affect your collaboration (emotionally, physically, etc.). Talk about how you’re doing with labs and the material, anything you’re trying to catch up on, or anything you understand really well. Take good care of each other as you collaborate — the goal is not to just get the lab done as fast as possible — but to fully understand the context, the steps, and the patterns that it introduces. If you’re having trouble focusing on the collaboration and just want to get to the code, remember that many job interviews involve a pairing exercise — your collaborative skills need to be sharp to do well there (as well as to succeed at the job once you get it!)
